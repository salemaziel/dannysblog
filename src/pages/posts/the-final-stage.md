Withering tree roots, foundation long ago corrupted, enters it's final stage.  

You'll never understand the process, only feel as bones become brittle, and crack from old age. 

Ready or not, the time has come, but you know not to be scared. There's no one left to call, no one left to care, cause in that final moment, 
You'll be the only one there.
